# functions

# functions are reusable block of codes
# functions have parameters that are defined during declaration and arguments during calling

# def my_function(x,y):
#     z = (2*x)+y
#     print(f'When x is {x} and y is {y}, z is {z}')



# to run the function we must call it by its name
# my_function(2,3)
# my_function(5,6)
# my_function(8,9)
# num = my_function(3,4)
# print(num)
# print(x,y,z)

# Task make a function to take first name and last name as parameters and concatenate them

# return in function

# def my_function(x,y):
#     z = (2*x)+y
#     return z
#
# num = my_function(1,2)
# print(num)
