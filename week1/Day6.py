# take two numbers as input

# print the sum

# Ask user if they want to continue

# if the user says no , terminate the program

# Assignment
# Build a billing system

# take 5 items' price from the user

# Calculate total for all items and add 13% V.A.T


# Hint :
# i = 1
# num = input(f'Enter price for item {i}')
